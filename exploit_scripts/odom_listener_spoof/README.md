This script builds and launches the `odom_listener_spoof_node`. It uses a relative path when changing to the `catkin_ws`, therefore the script has to be executed from this directory.

Step by step, it first builds the workspace. It includes all packages in the workspace. This is not required, but since there are few packages it is not an issue. The second step is `source devel/setup.bash` which loads all `ROS` packages in the workspace. Finally, `roslaunch` starts the node as specified in the launch file. The launch file is simple and the two interesting lines are `<group ns="/sam/dr">` and `respawn=true`. The first specifies what namespace the node should be launched in. The second indicates that the node should be restarted whenever it dies.
