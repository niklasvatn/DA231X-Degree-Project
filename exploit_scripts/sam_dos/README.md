Simple script for starting multiple nodes publishing to the topics:

- sam/dr/yaw
- sam/dr/pitch
- sam/dr/roll


It is run by `/sam_dos.sh <number_of_processes>` where the argument is optional and defaults to 0. The python script is a symlink pointing to the corresponding file in the catkin package. See `/catkin_ws/src_sam_dos.
